**Description:**
App entered foreground or resumed, but did not render or respond within the 10-second scene update window. Watchdog triggered a forced kill (`0x8BADF00D`). Likely due to heavy main-thread processing during launch or reactivationâ€”common in VPN initialisation.

**Suspected Root Causes:**
- Blocking network/VPN init on UI/main thread  
- Heavy synchronous code in scene lifecycle callbacks  
- Startup deadlock or long tasks during `sceneDidBecomeActive()`

**Steps to reproduce (if known):**
1. Launch PIA VPN  
2. Wait for UI to appear  
3. App freezes and gets killed after ~10 seconds
